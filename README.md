# portfolio

## Description

For this project, I have built a portfolio for myself. The portfolio includes three html files and one css file. The html files are index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html. The index.html serves as my home page and has a brief introduction of myself and a picture of myself. The portfolio.html serves as a space to show the different projects I have coded. The contact.html has a form to submit an email to me as well as my social media information. When building this website, I started by creating the bones of my website. I began by creating my title, header, navigation bar, content section and a footer. Next, I added my personal information and placeholder images into the specific areas that i previously outlined. Using bootstrap, I found an email form that I adjusted to fit my specific needs. 
Once the bones of my page were set, I then began to style my page. I changed the background of the body as well as the content section and added a border around my content section. I styled my navigation bar and added containers for my portfolio. Using bootstrap, I created a sticky footer and styled the footer to match the nagivation bar. Once I completed this, I then added a google font to personalize the font on my page.
